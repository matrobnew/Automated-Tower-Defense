# Automated-Tower-Defense for Unity3D
This is the C# code for my Unity3D Automated Tower Defense tutorial series on youtube, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3RNy9TZuT6FdE6VAZoYqWkwpG_fssreE

These are ONLY the five scripts discussed in detail in that tutorial, which are required for automated operation of the anti-aircraft gun installation itself (this installation can be duplicated as many times as you like, with each gun independently tracking the target).

The demo scene I use for the tutorial requires some kind of moving-target Player; in my case I use an F22 flight-sim model borrowed from Unity Standard Assets.  The scripts for flight control are quite complex, but I use them largely out of the box.  The stock F22 is unarmed; I have armed mine with machine guns, missiles and rockets.  The code for these armaments is my own, but not included here because it is not discussed in any depth in the tutorial.
